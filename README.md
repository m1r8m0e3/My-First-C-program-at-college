This code as the ability to Solve any of the given Quadratic Equations, Coefficients of a, b, c are to be given as a form of input
Ex. Output
Enter the coefficient of a
1
Enter the coefficient of b
2
Enter the coefficient of c
3
The Roots are Real and Imaginary
Root 1 = -1.000000+i1.414214
Root 2 = -1.000000-i1.414214
